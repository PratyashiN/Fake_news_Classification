Trump got into a feud with the Khan family, a Gold Star family who spoke about him. \\nTrump apparently didn\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t know what a Gold Star family is. This term is generally used to describe families who have lost a loved one in the military. \\nPaul Manafort, former advisor to George H.W. Bush\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s, Gerald Ford\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s, and Bob Dole\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s presidential campaigns, became an advisor for the Donald Trump campaign during the general election season. His plan was for Trump to go low profile, so the media would then focus on his rival, Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. \\nManafort was mad when Trump went after the Khan family instead of focusing on the issues. He said: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe election is about the American people, it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s not about you.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d \\nNow that we have less than two weeks until the election, Trump wants to rehash some of his craziest feuds. Trump said that if he were president Humayun Khan would still be alive. Khizr said : \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThis is the most cruel thing you can say to grieving parents, that if I was there this would not have happened. There\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s no sincerity in those remarks \\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6 This is one character that a leader must have to be the leader of a great country, to be the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the United States: empathy. And this person totally lacks that.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d \\nKhan is now joining Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail. \\nCheck out the campaign ad he made for the Clinton campaign: \\nAnd watch Khan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s entire speech from the convention : \\nFeatured image via YouTube screenshot .

The decision was unanimous. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI accept this as a just and appropriate judgment,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Mr. Jutting, 31, said in a statement that his lawyer read after the verdict was announced, according to a report in The South China Morning Post. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe evil I have inflicted can never be remedied by me in words or by action. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Murder convictions carry a mandatory life sentence in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese city that has its own legal system. Mr. Jutting had pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds of \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cdiminished responsibility,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d according to reports in the local news media. His lawyers said in court that the claim was based on his client\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s struggles with narcissism, sexual sadism and substance abuse. A government psychiatrist rejected that argument during the trial, saying that while cocaine and alcohol had impaired Mr. Jutting\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s   he was still responsible for the murders. Mr. Jutting, who had worked for Bank of America in Hong Kong and studied at Cambridge University in Britain, killed the women at his   in the Wan Chai neighborhood, a popular nightclub district. He tortured one, Sumarti Ningsih, 23, for three days before cutting her throat with a serrated knife and leaving her remains in a suitcase on his balcony, news reports said, citing a prosecutor\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s statements at the trial. He had met her through an internet forum. He slashed the throat of the second, Seneng Mujiasih, 26, whom he had met at a bar, after she noticed a rope gag in the apartment and began shouting. The case made headlines around the world, in part because of the grotesque nature of the killings, but also because Hong Kong is generally considered to be among the safest cities in Asia. Both women came to Hong Kong as domestic workers. Ms. Sumarti later returned on a tourist visa, and Ms. Seneng\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s domestic worker visa had lapsed. The city has more than 300, 000 foreign domestic workers, primarily from Indonesia and the Philippines. They are subject to more legal restrictions than other expatriate workers, including bankers. Advocacy groups say that employers and the government routinely treat the workers like   citizens and that they are vulnerable to abuse. Suyitno, Ms. Sumarti\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s older brother, who goes by one name, said in a statement on Tuesday that she came from a farming family and that she came to Hong Kong in early 2011. Mr. Suyitno said in the statement, issued before the verdict, that the family\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s economic condition had worsened since Ms. Sumarti\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s death because she had been its only breadwinner and that he hoped Mr. Jutting would be \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cpunished severely. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d He also demanded that the Indonesian government pay for the education of Ms. Sumarti\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s    son. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWe have no more income to ensure his education,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d he said. The Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a joint statement after the verdict, the victims\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 families said they felt relieved. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHowever, both families are very desperate because of their loss and worry for their future,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d the families said in the statement, which was provided by the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union in Hong Kong. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThey hope for proper compensation from Rurik Jutting. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Yustina, a friend of Ms. Sumarti\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s and a former domestic worker in Hong Kong who goes by one name, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that she was not comforted by the verdict. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWhat about my friend?\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Ms. Yustina said. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cShe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s gone forever. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\",\n          \"Writing with pen and paper hailed as latest twatty show-off thing to do 15-11-16 SITTING in a cafe with a notepad instead of a computer is the new twatty thing to do, it has been confirmed.

The Fed said on Wednesday, after a   meeting of its   committee, that it would not raise its benchmark interest rate, and that future increases were most likely to unfold at a slower pace. The   period since the end of the Great Recession has become one of the longest economic expansions in American history and, at the same time, one of the most disappointing. The Fed, in a statement announcing its decision, noted what had become a typical mix of good news and bad. Economic output has increased while job growth has slowed, the Fed said. Consumers are spending more while companies are making fewer investments. Exports are rebounding, but Britain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s June 23 referendum on whether to leave the European Union could set off another round of disruptions. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cRecent economic indicators have been mixed, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told a news conference. The decision to wait was unanimous. Even Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who voted to raise rates at the Fed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s last few meetings, agreed this time that the moment was not ripe. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe labor market appears to have slowed down, and we need to assure ourselves that the underlying momentum in the economy has not diminished,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Ms. Yellen said. Investors already are heavily discounting the chances of a rate increase at the Fed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s next meeting in July, or at the following meeting in September. Those chances, derived from asset prices, stood at 12 percent and 28 percent respectively on Wednesday, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In this environment of tepid growth and weak inflation, Fed officials once again dialed back their expectations for future rate increases. The Fed in December had predicted four rate increases this year. On Wednesday, the Fed released new projections showing that 15 of its 17 policy makers now expected no more than two increases this year, and six of those officials predicted just one. Even more striking, the median prediction of Fed officials was that the central bank\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s benchmark rate would rise to just 2. 4 percent by the end of 2018, down from the March median of 3 percent. That suggests officials increasingly regard mediocre global economic growth as an enduring malaise. The Fed also appears increasingly open to the view that a shift in basic economic dynamics, driven by factors like lower productivity growth and an aging population, is holding down interest rates. That means low rates are less stimulative than they would have been in earlier eras. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIt means that long rates can remain low without causing the economy to overheat, and therefore the urgency of tightening is very substantially diminished,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist. Markets are even more pessimistic than the Fed. The yield on the benchmark   Treasury fell to 1. 574 percent, the lowest level since 2012. That is part of a broader decline in global rates that, in recent days, also has sent the yield on   German debt below zero for the first time. Equity markets, which in recent years have often celebrated when central banks hold down rates, also declined modestly on Wednesday. The Standard  Poor\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s   index fell 0. 18 percent to close at 2, 071. 50. Fed officials increasingly think the economy has exited its postcrisis period, according to economic projections the central bank published on Wednesday. The recovery, in other words, may not be complete, but it is over. Most officials predicted stable growth around 2 percent over the next few years, and they foresaw little if any additional decline in the unemployment rate, which fell to 4. 7 percent in May, the lowest level unemployment had reached since 2007, before the recession. But economic growth has disappointed expectations, and the Fed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s benchmark rate remains in a range between 0. 25 and 0. 5 percent after a single rate increase last December. As recently as late May, Ms. Yellen predicted the Fed would raise rates in \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cthe coming months. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d On Wednesday, she downgraded a summer move to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnot impossible. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen, said the Fed was standing still because the basic economic situation had been remarkably stable. For the last several years, the labor market has gradually improved while inflation has been sluggish. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI suspect that the core policy developments have never been so static for so long,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Mr. Faust wrote. Under those circumstances it makes perfect sense for the Fed to watch and wait. Consumer spending has driven domestic economic growth, and Ms. Yellen said she expected the trend to continue on the back of job growth and rising wages. But Fed officials were surprised by the slow pace of job growth in May, when the economy was estimated to have added just 38, 000 jobs. And a Fed index that summarizes labor market conditions has fallen to the lowest level in seven years. Officials also have expressed increased concern about inflation expectations, which play a significant role in determining future inflation. (Workers, for example, may seek larger raises if they expect prices to rise more quickly.) The University of Michigan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s consumer survey reported last week that consumers expected 2. 3 percent annual inflation in five years, the lowest level in the survey\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s history. Ms. Yellen emphasized again on Wednesday that Fed officials also saw significant risks in moving too quickly. Because interest rates already are low, the Fed has little room to ease conditions if growth falters. Officials say it will be easier to respond to faster inflation than to an economic downturn. Some economists see evidence that the Fed itself is playing a role in the slowdown. The Fed raised rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis, and officials have made clear that they would like to keep raising rates. Moreover, the decline in the Fed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s projection of   interest rates suggests that the Fed may have underestimated the impact of its actions in December. But Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that the Fed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s move in December amounted to a small adjustment in rates, and that she did not agree with critics that it had an outsize impact. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI really don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t think that a single rate increase in December has had much significance for the outlook,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d she said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Fed said on Wednesday, after a   meeting of its   committee, that it would not raise its benchmark interest rate, and that future increases were most likely to unfold at a slower pace. The   period since the end of the Great Recession has become one of the longest economic expansions in American history and, at the same time, one of the most disappointing. The Fed, in a statement announcing its decision, noted what had become a typical mix of good news and bad. Economic output has increased while job growth has slowed, the Fed said. Consumers are spending more while companies are making fewer investments. Exports are rebounding, but Britain\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s June 23 referendum on whether to leave the European Union could set off another round of disruptions. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cRecent economic indicators have been mixed, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told a news conference. The decision to wait was unanimous. Even Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who voted to raise rates at the Fed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s last few meetings, agreed this time that the moment was not ripe. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cThe labor market appears to have slowed down, and we need to assure ourselves that the underlying momentum in the economy has not diminished,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Ms. Yellen said. Investors already are heavily discounting the chances of a rate increase at the Fed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s next meeting in July, or at the following meeting in September. Those chances, derived from asset prices, stood at 12 percent and 28 percent respectively on Wednesday, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In this environment of tepid growth and weak inflation, Fed officials once again dialed back their expectations for future rate increases. The Fed in December had predicted four rate increases this year. On Wednesday, the Fed released new projections showing that 15 of its 17 policy makers now expected no more than two increases this year, and six of those officials predicted just one. Even more striking, the median prediction of Fed officials was that the central bank\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s benchmark rate would rise to just 2. 4 percent by the end of 2018, down from the March median of 3 percent. That suggests officials increasingly regard mediocre global economic growth as an enduring malaise. The Fed also appears increasingly open to the view that a shift in basic economic dynamics, driven by factors like lower productivity growth and an aging population, is holding down interest rates. That means low rates are less stimulative than they would have been in earlier eras. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIt means that long rates can remain low without causing the economy to overheat, and therefore the urgency of tightening is very substantially diminished,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist. Markets are even more pessimistic than the Fed. The yield on the benchmark   Treasury fell to 1. 574 percent, the lowest level since 2012. That is part of a broader decline in global rates that, in recent days, also has sent the yield on   German debt below zero for the first time. Equity markets, which in recent years have often celebrated when central banks hold down rates, also declined modestly on Wednesday. The Standard  Poor\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s   index fell 0. 18 percent to close at 2, 071. 50. Fed officials increasingly think the economy has exited its postcrisis period, according to economic projections the central bank published on Wednesday. The recovery, in other words, may not be complete, but it is over. Most officials predicted stable growth around 2 percent over the next few years, and they foresaw little if any additional decline in the unemployment rate, which fell to 4. 7 percent in May, the lowest level unemployment had reached since 2007, before the recession. But economic growth has disappointed expectations, and the Fed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s benchmark rate remains in a range between 0. 25 and 0. 5 percent after a single rate increase last December. As recently as late May, Ms. Yellen predicted the Fed would raise rates in \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cthe coming months. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d On Wednesday, she downgraded a summer move to \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnot impossible. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen, said the Fed was standing still because the basic economic situation had been remarkably stable. For the last several years, the labor market has gradually improved while inflation has been sluggish. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI suspect that the core policy developments have never been so static for so long,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Mr. Faust wrote. Under those circumstances it makes perfect sense for the Fed to watch and wait. Consumer spending has driven domestic economic growth, and Ms. Yellen said she expected the trend to continue on the back of job growth and rising wages. But Fed officials were surprised by the slow pace of job growth in May, when the economy was estimated to have added just 38, 000 jobs. And a Fed index that summarizes labor market conditions has fallen to the lowest level in seven years. Officials also have expressed increased concern about inflation expectations, which play a significant role in determining future inflation. (Workers, for example, may seek larger raises if they expect prices to rise more quickly.) The University of Michigan\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s consumer survey reported last week that consumers expected 2. 3 percent annual inflation in five years, the lowest level in the survey\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s history. Ms. Yellen emphasized again on Wednesday that Fed officials also saw significant risks in moving too quickly. Because interest rates already are low, the Fed has little room to ease conditions if growth falters. Officials say it will be easier to respond to faster inflation than to an economic downturn. Some economists see evidence that the Fed itself is playing a role in the slowdown. The Fed raised rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis, and officials have made clear that they would like to keep raising rates. Moreover, the decline in the Fed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s projection of   interest rates suggests that the Fed may have underestimated the impact of its actions in December. But Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that the Fed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s move in December amounted to a small adjustment in rates, and that she did not agree with critics that it had an outsize impact. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI really don\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099t think that a single rate increase in December has had much significance for the outlook,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d she said.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
