# Fake News Classification using LSTM

This project focuses on detecting fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a deep learning model based on a Bidirectional LSTM network.

## Project Overview
Fake news detection is a significant challenge in the digital age. This project builds a binary text classification model that classifies news articles as Fake or Real using sequence modeling techniques.

The notebook includes data preprocessing, tokenization, padding, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Bidirectional LSTM
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Model Architecture
- Embedding Layer
- Bidirectional LSTM Layer
- Fully Connected Dense Layer with Sigmoid Activation

## Files in Repository
- `Fake_news_Classification.ipynb`  
  Complete notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

## Output
- Binary classification of news articles as Fake or Real.
- Model performance evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.

## Future Improvements
- Use pre-trained word embeddings such as GloVe or Word2Vec.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Add attention mechanism for better performance.
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask.
